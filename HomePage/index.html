            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>Hi! I'm Anna-Trang, I'm a college graduate with a degree in biology with a minor in neuroscience. After working as an emergency room medical scribe, my
            desire to become a doctor disappeared. Now I had to come up with a new career route/goals I wanted to achieve, so I started searching. While searching
            the world of coding, robotics, and AI peaked my interest. Graduation was just around the corner and I needed to decide what to do, so I finished my undergrad 
            degree, and decided to begin my journey into the coding. I am currently using a self-pace course to become a full-stack developer.</p>
            <p> On my free time, I enjoy playing games, crocheting and cooking! I'm always looking for things to learn and love a good challenge.</p>
